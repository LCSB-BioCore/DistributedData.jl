    save_at(worker, sym, val)

Saves value `val` to symbol `sym` at `worker`. `sym` should be quoted (or
contain a symbol). `val` gets unquoted in the processing and evaluated at the
worker, quote it if you want to pass exact command to the worker.

This is loosely based on the package ParallelDataTransfers, but made slightly
more flexible by omitting/delaying the explicit fetches etc. In particular,
`save_at` is roughly the same as `ParallelDataTransfers.sendto`, and
`get_val_from` works very much like `ParallelDataTransfers.getfrom`.

# Return value

A future with Nothing that can be fetched to see that the operation has
finished.

# Examples

    addprocs(1)
    save_at(2,:x,123)       # saves 123
    save_at(2,:x,myid())    # saves 1
    save_at(2,:x,:(myid())) # saves 2
    save_at(2,:x,:(:x))     # saves the symbol :x
                            # (just :x won't work because of unquoting)

# Note: Symbol scope

The symbols are saved in Main module on the corresponding worker. For example,
`save_at(1, :x, nothing)` _will_ erase your local `x` variable. Beware of name
collisions.

    dmapreduce(val, map, fold, workers)

A distributed work-alike of the standard `mapreduce`: Take a function `map` (a
non-modifying transform on the data) and `fold` (2-to-1 reduction of the
results of `map`), systematically run them on the data described by `val`
distributed on `workers`, and return the final reduced result.

It is assumed that the fold operation is associative, but not commutative (as
in semigroups). If there are no workers, operation returns `nothing` (we don't
have a monoid to magically conjure zero elements :[ ).

In current version, the reduce step is a sequential left fold, executed in the
main process.

# Example
    # compute the mean of all distributed data
    sum,len = dmapreduce(:myData,
        (d) -> (sum(d),length(d)),
        ((s1, l1), (s2, l2)) -> (s1+s2, l1+l2),
        workers())
    println(sum/len)

# Processing multiple arguments (a.k.a. "zipWith")

The `val` here does not necessarily need to refer to a symbol, you can easily
pass in a quoted tuple, which will be unquoted in the function parameter. For
example, distributed values `:a` and `:b` can be joined as such:

    dmapreduce(:((a,b)),
        ((a,b)::Tuple) -> [a b],

    @remote expr

In a function that will get evaluated on a remote worker, this ensures the
evaluation scope of the expression `expr` (usually a variable) is taken on
the remote side, preventing namespace clash with the local session.

This is mainly useful for making the functions from `Distributed` package (such
as `pmap` and `remotecall`) work with the data stored by `DistributedData`
package.

Internally, this is handled by wrapping in `eval`.
